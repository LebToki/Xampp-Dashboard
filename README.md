Our UI automatically detects any projects and directories within your root directory, making it easy to manage your work. Plus, we've included an automated auto-detection for popular frameworks like WordPress, Laravel, and Symfony. We've gone the extra mile to provide a visually appealing and intuitive interface that's easy to navigate, so you can spend more time coding and less time searching for files. And with a responsive design, you can access our UI on any device.

# ![Screenshot of XAMPP Dashboard Logo](assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png)  How to use

1. Replace the default index.php file in your XAMPP root directory with our customized index.php file.
2. your laragon hostname template (.local) will be automatically detected and served here (line 249 is your friend)

```[php]
   function getLocalSites($server = 'apache', $ignoredFiles = ['.', '..', '00-default.conf']): array{}
```

3. Upload the icons and CSS files to the assets directory (or simply import them as is).

4. add whatever directories that you don't intend to expose publicly (line 316)

```[php]
$ignore_dirs = array('.', '..', 'logs', 'access-logs', 'vendor', 'favicon_io', 'assets');
```
